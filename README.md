jQuery Image Accordeon
====================

Using this plugin, you can make a fancy accordeon of images. The images can for example be in a grid form, with some rows and columns. By clicking an image, more details slide in as a new row under it.

Usage
-----

### HTML


### JS
Make sure you've loaded jQuery and then *jquery.imageaccordeon.js* in your HTML before the plugin call. I personally like to place my scripts file at the end of the body, and using an asynchronous loader for the plugins. You're free to choose though. Call the plugin wrapped in a `$(document).ready(function { })`. This is a sample of the call with all posible options and defaults:

<!--
	$("ul.tags").tagfiltering({
		items: ".filter-items",
		active_class: "active"		// css class used to indicate selected tags
		quicksand: false			// enables reorder animations using Quicksand (required import of Quicksand plugin before Tag Filtering)
	});
 -->
